# Risk Assessment

## Introduction

This document lists the current risks associated with the project.  Each risk has a corollary impact and mitigation. Each risk will be reevaluated during every iteration. 


# Risks
## Android fragmentation
### Description

Program compatibility with highly fragmented Android devices.

### Impacts

Using an old version of the Android API will preclude certain features. Using a newer version of the Android API will cause incompatibility for certain Android users with older devices.

### Mitigation Strategy

Decide on a trade-off between needed API features and compatibility.

## Central Server Specification

### Description

Though not fully defined, there have been implications that the Coffee Cart Rewards System should synchronize with a central server.  

### Impacts

This could lead to scope creep, as it is not initially defined in the requirements documentation and would leave less time available for implementation of Release 1.

### Mitigation Strategy

This feature should not be considered for Release 1.

## New development process

### Description

Some of the members of the development team are new to the Unified Software Process (USP).

### Impacts

More time may be needed for USP documentation artifacts. Less time available for implementation.

### Mitigation Strategy

Some features may need to be considered as optional.


## Remote development

### Description

The development team is part-time and distributed geographically across multiple time zones.

### Impacts

Interactions will be less frequent. Meetings could be challenging to schedule. 

### Mitigation Strategy

Use weekly meetings and ad-hoc emails to keep everyone up to date on status and any blocking issues.
